PLEASE BE SURE TO READ THIS ENTIRE DOCUMENT, AS IT DESCRIBES THE FORMAT AND REQUIREMENTS OF THE SAMPLE CODE
DOWNLOAD ZIP ARCHIVES. We hope you have fun with the sample code we have included and that you find it useful
and informative. Enjoy!

This ZIP archive contains code from every chapter and appendix of the book with the exception of those with
folders designating no code. Please also note that, in some cases, certain examples or listings from the
chapters are not included because the example is generated code, output, or something you would never enter
yourself. It is also possible to download the sample code for each chapter individually. If you have done this,
only the code for the chapter you downloaded is contained within this ZIP archive.

As of 2014-Feb-11, the sample code is only available as IntelliJ IDEA projects. Once a stable Eclipse version
supports Java SE 8, Java EE 7, and Apache Tomcat 8, the code on the download site will be updated to provide
Eclipse projects as well. If you are working with a pre-release edition of Eclipse, you should be able to
import the IntelliJ IDEA projects as simple Maven projects. Remember that your book comes with a free 90-day
IntelliJ IDEA 13 Ultimate personal license. We encourage you to try it instead of using Eclipse, as you will
get a better overall experience.

The layout of the ZIP archives for individual chapters looks like this, where XX is the chapter number (with
leading zeroes where applicable):

656464 cXX Code.zip
  |
  --Eclipse
      |
      --Sample Project 1
      --Sample Project n
  --IntelliJ
      |
      --Sample Project 1
      --Sample Project n

The only exceptions to this pattern are Chapter 2, which does not contain "IntelliJ" and "Eclipse" folders,
and Chapter 8, which contains files that aren't IDE projects IN ADDITION TO the standard "IntelliJ" and
"Eclipse" folders. The organization of these chapters' sample code is self-evident.

The ZIP archive for the entire book looks only slightly different:

9781118656464 Full Code.zip
  |
  --Chapter XX
      |
      --Eclipse
          |
          --Sample Project 1
          --Sample Project n
      --IntelliJ
          |
          --Sample Project 1
          --Sample Project n
  --Chapter XX
      |
      ...

Whether you download all the code for the entire book at once or individual chapters, not every chapter has
downloadable sample code. The following chapters DO NOT have sample code, so don't be alarmed when you cannot
find it:

Chapter 1
Chapter 19
Chapter 25
